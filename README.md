## Known issues to fix:

- [x] There's a discrepancy between the timecodes in the HTML player and local players (specifically Final Cut Pro X). Not too severe, as the web player can be updated for better double-checking.
  - Fixed: Display custom timecode and generate two buttons to choose which timecode to copy.
