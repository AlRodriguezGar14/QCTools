## Known issues to fix:

- [ ] There's a discrepancy between the timecodes in the HTML player and local players (specifically Final Cut Pro X). Not too severe, as the web player can be updated for better double-checking.
Potential solutions/brainstorming:
	- Use a player that receives frames instead of timecodes to double-check locally
	- Instead of displaying the timecodes on the web, use the local timecodes
	- Build a converter in the HTML (.js) to convert the timecodes from the web to local
